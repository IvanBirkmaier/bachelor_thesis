## Project Description

This bachelor's thesis investigates the advantages of a shared repository for automated deployment using cloud technologies. The developed prototype is publicly accessible on GitHub and utilizes various modern technologies. The core of the project is the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire deployment process.

**Key Components of the Project:**
- Examination of the benefits of a shared repository for automated deployment
- Development of a publicly accessible prototype
- Utilization of Docker and Nx as primary technologies
- Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process

## Tech Stack

The following key technologies were used for this project:

- **Docker**: Containerization of applications to ensure a consistent and isolated execution environment.
- **CI/CD Tools (Workflows)**: Automation of build, test, and deployment processes to ensure a continuous and error-free software delivery process.
- **Nx-Cloud**: Monorepo tooling for scaling and optimizing development and build processes in large projects.
